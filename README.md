## Running Locally

Instead of relying on Google Colab, Iâ€™ve set things up to run on a local GPU environment for better control and performance. All necessary dependencies and environment configurations are predefined in a Dockerfile.
<br>
After chaning directory to `cs231n-solution`. build the docker
```bash
  docker build --tag pytorch-gpu .
  docker run --gpus=all -d -it --privileged  --name pytorch-gpu pytorch-gpu
```
